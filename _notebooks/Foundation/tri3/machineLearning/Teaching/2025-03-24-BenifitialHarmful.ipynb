    "Computer science has greatly advanced science and medicine by allowing faster data analysis which can be a big help in the medical field to filter through diffrent diagnosis. Computer models can also be used to simulate diseases and test treatments before clinical trials. Technologies like AI help doctors detect conditions such as cancer and heart disease earlier and more accurately. Robotics and computer-controlled surgery have made complex procedures safer and less sesptible to human error. Overall, I believe this is a benifitial effect/use of computers and computer science as it can help develop new technologys and treatments to save lives."
