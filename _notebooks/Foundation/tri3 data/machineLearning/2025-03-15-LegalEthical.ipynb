    "## **Intellectual Property (IP)**\n",
    "Definition: Intellectual Property (IP) refers to creations of the mind, including inventions, literary and artistic works, designs, symbols, names, and images used in commerce. It grants creators exclusive rights to their work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Digital Impact on IP:\n",
    "- The digitization of information has made it easier to share, copy, and distribute content online.\n",
    "- While this has increased accessibility, it has also raised concerns about ownership, unauthorized use, and infringement.\n",
    "- Businesses and individuals struggle to protect their digital assets from unauthorized replication or misuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Copyright Protection:\n",
    "- Copyright safeguards original works such as books, music, films, and digital content.\n",
    "- It prevents unauthorized use, reproduction, or distribution of creative works.\n",
    "- Copyright protection is automatic upon creation, but registration offers additional legal advantages.\n",
    "- Infringement can lead to penalties, including fines or legal action.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other Forms of IP Protection:\n",
    "- Patents: Protect inventions by granting exclusive rights to inventors.\n",
    "- Trademarks: Safeguard brand names, logos, and slogans from unauthorized use.\n",
    "- Trade Secrets: Cover confidential business information that provides a competitive advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enforcing IP Rights:\n",
    "- Legal measures such as licensing agreements and digital rights management (DRM) help control IP usage.\n",
    "- Companies and creators must actively monitor and enforce their rights to prevent infringement.\n",
    "- IP protection continues to evolve with advancements in technology and digital platforms."

    "- Open source are programs that are made freely available for anyone to use and make modifications to (through their own version of the content)\n",
    "- Open Source Code --> Encourages people to collaborate and contribute to your creation\n",
    "- Open access is online research free of any and all restrictions on access and free of several restrictions on use, such as copyright and license restrictions\n",
